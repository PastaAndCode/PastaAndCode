👋 Welcome to @PastaAndCode's (Michael DeCavalcante's) GitHub! With over 20 years in the software development arena, I craft custom software experiences that resonate. Balancing life as a devoted family man and a dedicated developer, I pour my passion into code and clients alike.

🌟 Excelling in translating intricate challenges into user-centric and scalable software, I now wield the robust C# and .NET frameworks to engineer solutions that propel businesses and captivate users.

🚀 Venturing into the forefront of UI/UX design trends, software automation, and AI integration, my goal is to position my clients at the vanguard of innovation.

🔍 I’m eager to collaborate with visionaries who aim to leave a mark through tech. Ready to disrupt or in need of a solid digital foundation? We should talk.
